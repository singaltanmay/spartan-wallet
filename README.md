# Spartan Wallet

Spartan Wallet is a BIP 32, 39, 44 compliant software wallet built for the [Spartan Gold](https://github.com/taustin/spartan-gold) model cryptocurrency. See the report for more information - https://github.com/singaltanmay/spartan-wallet/blob/master/Spartan_Wallet_Project_Report.pdf

## Abstract from the Report

Spartan Gold is a cryptocurrency developed as an academic exercise to emulate the proof-of-work protocol of Bitcoin. While it has achieved feature parity with real-life currencies, its lack of user-friendliness limits its mainstream deployment. This project focuses on developing a Hierarchical Deterministic (HD) wallet for Spartan Gold that is compliant with the widely used BIPs 32, 39, and 44. These BIPs provide standards for HD wallets, mnemonic phrases, and account hierarchies, respectively. By implementing these standards, the wallet improves user-friendliness, backup and recovery processes, privacy, and the ability to organize transactions into different accounts. The implementation of a BIP-compliant wallet for Spartan Gold would significantly improve the currencyâ€™s prospects of being used as a real cryptocurrency, expanding its current utility as an academic exercise. This report provides a comprehensive guide to the development process of the wallet and valuable insights into creating a BIP-compliant cryptocurrency wallet.
